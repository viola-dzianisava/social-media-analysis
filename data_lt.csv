The Conservative party has basically self-destructed over the last 2 years. Currently voting intention polls have Labour (our second biggest party) winning >50% of the votes, with the Conservatives winning about 20%. Some polls have them doing so badly that they would lose the official Opposition title and instead being a 3rd or 4th place party. 

The Government is on its 4th Finance Minister in 4 months, it's 2nd Home Secretary this year. Has scrapped most of its 2019 election manifesto promises. Has axed pretty much all of the mini-budget. Is set to unveil another budget at the end of the month; will likely go down badly as well.

comment,isx5yrv,,"> As an outsider to UK politics, is it legit possible she is already done?

Yes, and it's very probable

The bottom line (policy failures apart) is that she has the communication skills of a low intensity droning cement mixer, and the personal charisma of an unflushed toilet. That being so, she can't win an election and once the Tory party decides that's the case, they usually drop the dead donkey very quickly (unless they're so far into the cycle that they're tacitly surrendering). I'm not sure the 'fall guy' logic applies to Truss though. There is a difference between damage limitation (accepting defeat) and getting burned to a crisp (the trajectory she's on)

The problem the party has however is finding a replacement. They don't want another drawn out self-regarding 10 week tour of the regions whilst they shuffle the Titanic around the deck chairs again

Clearly Johnson wants back in, and that's problematic. Johnson's supporters (and there's plenty that exist) don't want Sunak as they see him as a back-stabbing traitor. So there is a potential clash here

After her hideous performance yesterday with that hysterical audition, it's perfectly obvious that the evil Suella Braverman fancies the job, so she needs putting back in her box and telling that she isn't to run.  

I'm sure the candidate they'd all rally around as being acceptable to all is Ben Wallace, but he's really a bit of a one trick pony. He's basically a former Scots Guardsman, who is clearly comfortable in the Defence portfolio. He's got very little background in economic management and that's where the focus needs to be. 

Wallace declined to run a few months ago, clearly foreseeing where the elephant traps were along the road, so I expect he's being heavily leaned upon to agree this time. If I had to guess, I suspect they'll succeed in persuading him to do so this time, and this could be the delay we're witnessing. 

Wallace would probably be the candidate Labour would fear most, but if he's to be inserted as PM it's likely to be a coronation and an uncontested appoitment. They could possibly set something up in a similar manner to the way that Andrea Leadsom, having gotten into the last two, she withdrew her nomination allowing for a swift coronation of Theresa May and so prevent the need to take it to their membership

I'm quite sure for all they're saying publicly, Labour would much rather keep Truss in post",10/19/22 13:50,y7v9zy

May took over after Cameron ditched because of Brexit, couldn't pass a reasonable Brexit, tried to sure up her lead and lost her majority and left after a no-confidence. 

BoJo was really good at appearing as a man of the people, pulling typically working class labour voters to the conservatives, and Corbyn was hammered in the press and obstinate on a few keys points (brexit, claims of antisemitism, etc). With the dissolving of UKIP, those votes folded in to the pro-brexit tory party.

Tories basically have the press on their side, and labour can't make its fucking mind up on whether it wants to be a party of the working and middle class or just a generic centrist neoliberal party.

Dave who works 60 hours a week, has 4 GCSEs and lives on a crime ridden estate wants to vote for a party that helps him (but none appear to be that party) and does not respond well to LGBT+ and immigrant and therefore aligns with the Tories on social issues (re: ""Trans question"", hard brexit border, deportation of asylum seekers, good ol' nationalism).

comment,isx0b2f,,"The first term was voted in off the back of blunders of the previous Labour government and people wanted change (Iraq war, 2008 financial crisis which wasn't handled that badly in comparison). 

The second term was more like a status quo vote, combined with a bit of a smear campaign against David Millibands Labour party. This term crossed over with the Brexit vote.

The 3rd term was voted in because the Tory parties angle was to 'get Brexit done' whereas the other parties either didn't have a hard stance on it or were mainly in favor of remain, so most that voted leave for Brexit, voted for the tories to carry it out. In addition the Labour party lead by Jeremy Corbyn who were the main opposition at this time were far more left leaning and mainly a remain party which went against the people that voted leave. There was also a huge smear campaign in the national press against him filled with controversies and accusations that made the party unelectable along with other things. 

We're in that term now and the Tory party along with their 12-13 years of austerity and increasingly outward corruption combined with COVID-19, energy and cost of living crisis has unravelled to bring the country to it's knees. It's only now that the Tory party is really scraping the bottom of the barrel and putting in increasingly inept MPs that are either self serving or completely out of their depth that even normal Tory voters are having none of it.",10/19/22 12:35,y7v9zy

comment,iskwopm,,"What you're actually witnessing is the UKIP take over of the conservative party, it's just the British public needn't quite have realised the extent of it and are still regarding the Tories as *the conservative party* rather than recognising them for what they are

You had those Tories for whom the party had lost them. They resigned and joined other parties, the likes of Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollastone, Heidi Allen and Nick Boules

Then (and more critically) you had the Boris purge in 2019 at the behest of Dominic Cummings, when the whip was withdrawn from the likes of Phillip Hammond, Justine Greening, Amber Rudd, hell, they even expelled Michael Heseltine

What happened naturally enough is the old tradition of 'one nation' conservatives was killed off, and with it, their moderating influence. This was followed by an influx of younger Breixteer/ UKIPers who replaced them. They tend to be big on rhetoric and not particularly talented, which is why you're seeing the catalogue of mistakes they're making. They basically aren't very good

Truss is interesting in so much as she's actually a remainer (albeit she's disavowed that cause). She's basically a bit of a psychopath, with clear Dunning Kruger syndrome. She was leant support by the ERG (and that Dickensian villain) because they recognised in her that she would be prepared to do a deal with them in return for office

I remember a friend of mine (an SDP councillor) from the early 80's boldly telling me that they'd be forming a government within a decade. I reminded them of it years later.

They smiled, and said ""have you seen the government"" (new Labour).

He had a point

This is what you're basically seeing again, This is what a UKIP government looks like

They're hopelessly equipped to resolve the challenges they face however because they fundamentally refuse to recognise what the single biggest cause of them is. They're going to look for any of end of alternative explanations and charge off pursuing fantastical ideas if it helps deflect from the source (like printing money to cure inflation!)

You can only get the correct answer if you're asking the right question. At the moment policy is being formulated in a vacuum of denial. It's a blind allegiance to face the truth

They're going to get wiped out with Truss in charge. Too many people have made that deal with themselves now for them to reverse it

She is toast

Question is when will people realise and will the tory party become unelectable because of it?

With the current UK FPTP electoral system only 2 parties have a realistic chance of winning but they don't have to be the same two for ever. There is historical precedent as the 2 major parties used to be Liberals (rather than labour) and tories.

I can see three ways this could play out

&#x200B;

1. People realise that the Tory party has been taken over and has changed from being a right wing, business friendly, globalist party to being a xenophobic, populist, business hostile party and the tory party becomes unelectable, leading to a duopoly of labour and either lib dems or a new party created by those thrown out the old tory party
2. The tory party realises what has happened and kicks out the ERG and UKIP side and returns to what it used to be
3. The populist / xenephobic stuff is actually what the UK wants and get more of the same, becoming closer to Hungry and Russia",10/16/22 22:52,y59fv6

No.1 is the most likely scenario medium term, but I'm not sure that the people of realised yet that the Tory party is what you UKIP would have become. They still seem to be viewing them as a conservative party who've run out of steam and competence rather than a fundamentally changed party. I don't sense yet that they've joined the dots up, and its perhaps going to take the media and opposition parties to ram this message home

I suspect what we might see is the Liberals and Labour set about introducing electoral reform to lock the Tories out forever. Of course in the context of the UK it's going to be difficult with straight PR as the UK has some over-represented nationalist parties who are bound to object

No.2 would take a decade to achieve similar to how Kinnock rid Labour of Militant (only for them re-emerge under Corbyn). It likely comes down to branch associations and the selection of candidates

comment,isl5ilj,,"Oh, absolutely agreed but given that the current system means the Tories decide when the GE is, and calling one any time soon could literally end the party entirely, it's unlikely.


I suppose as devil's advocate... The Tories get destroyed, party goes away. Lib Dems probably take some of the flotsam on, and if they're well known people who have won seats, possibly the Lib Dems pull further to the right (while remaining anti-Brexit more than likely).


Then you have the resurgence of something like the BNP/UKIP for all the ERG and their supporters within the current Tories. And they'll win votes. 


Even collapsing the Tory party, it doesn't entirely rid us of the extreme late stage capitalists or the racists or the morons. They'll get a new badge to pin to their tie, carry on and people will still vote for them. And when Labour do lose power, whatever replaces them may be a lot worse than today's Tories.

These tax cuts were (in their minds) designed to promote growth (it will do very little of that) and leave more money in people's pockets (sums so marginal they will barely make a difference), but will at the same time hugely increase the budget deficit. This also in turn increases interest rates, meaning the government is both borrowing more, and at a much higher cost- a double whammy. With the cost of both mortgages and corporate borrowing going through the roof (I work in corporate lending, a lot of companies are struggling to borrow), it means there's even less money available for consumption or investment.

For people on the median salary this puts an extra £20 a month into their pockets.

The budget wasn't supposed to stimulate growth by giving the working class more money.

Now someone on £150k+ will end up with an extra £1000 a month in their pocket, however it has been shown time and time again that these people spend a way lower % of their income in the first place, so all that's going to happen is less money will be invested into the country and will end up being hoarded in a way that is destroying the economy as it is.

comment,is0obqq,,"In 2019, the British people voted for the Conservative party, based on a hardening of the right wing vote around accomplishing Brexit and a dislike in the population at large for Corbyn, leader of Labour who are the party of opposition. The Conservatives, lead by Boris Johnson, won with a 40%ish vote share to 25%ish, but because of the first past the post system they had a healthy majority in Parliament.

Since then and most notably since the end of Covid restrictions in the UK, the Conservative party have been characterised by sleaze which made them unpopular to the general population. A major turning point where Labour went ahead in the polls was about the Conservatives allegedly breaking their own rules during Covid to host parties. This sleaze culminated in Johnson being forced from office by internal pressure in his party.

As the British people vote for the party, not a single prime minister, the party in government remains in government if they can elect a new leader capable of forming one. The Conservatives’ own system takes a decent while, returning two candidates from within the Parliamentary party that members of the party around the country vote on. In reality, this numbers about 150,000 voters which makes up about 0.25% of the country. The party members are also disproportionately southerners, male, and white. This has grown discontentment as the Prime Minister hasn’t been voted for by 99.75% of the country.

Whilst the election was going on over the summer, Conservative sleaze was accompanied by a cost of living crisis in the UK, particularly energy bills but also food, transportation, and wages. Lots of unions have been striking in the last three or four months, growing discontentment further.

One of the first things Truss and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced was a mini-budget. The effects in confidence were so profound it crashed the value of the pound compared to the dollar and required unprecedented action by the IMF and the Bank of England. Fiscal responsibility is one of the Conservative party’s major beliefs.

Essentially, the government is wildly unpopular anyway, forces the old prime minister to resign, ignores growing discontentment, effectively appoints a new prime minister, and then the first thing the new prime minister does is a catastrophic failure. The gap between the conservatives and their opposition is now being polled at around 50% for Labour and 20% for the Conservatives. 

There have been rumours already of a vote of no confidence within Parliament and it is clear that the public have no faith in her as Prime Minister. Whilst Parliament is technically bound to five year terms, it is fairly simple to force an election if the majority government wants one - the last two electoral cycles were about two years each. However, Conservative unpopularity means they will do terribly at an election in the near future and as such Truss won’t call one.",10/12/22 16:27,y21z0y

post,is2qgqz,,"Yeah, in the US we'd call a 5 year fix a 5/1 ARM (meaning an adjustable rate, fixed for the first 5 years, and able to be changed once per year after that).

I definitely agree that getting one that's adjustable right from the start seems like a bad idea, unless you're really sure that rates are historically high right now (and even then, it's a risk, since you could just refinance if rates drop so you're never really ""locked"" into high rates).",10/13/22 0:37,y21z0y

comment,irm6t3r,,"I think you're confused. CAP is a framework and it's up to each country to decide how to implement it. We've had this issue in Ireland as well - bad policy being blamed on CAP but when you drill down into it, it's often (not always) the individual country's policy is the issue - sometimes coming down to how something is worded (or not specifically addressed) in the the Statutory Instrument. In addition, some issues are blamed on CAP but are the result of economic pressures during the lifespan of CAP.

You mention hedgerows and they are a good example. In Ireland in the 70's, 80's and 90's, hedgerows were removed to make fields bigger for more efficient cereal and fodder production. This was not funded by CAP.
In the 2000's, environmental legislation was brought in under the CAP umbrella for funding new hedgerow planting and protection of existing hedgerows. Early iterations of this were ineffective because they failed to correctly word protection of existing hedgerows. This was subsequently addressed but the success/failure was up to our own government, not the CAP framework - which is very broad when you actually read it.
All the stuff you mention could have been implemented by the UK when still under CAP. We're doing some of it now such as results-based environment farming, catch-crops and leaving stubble in fields.

My work involves some of this policy and I've seen gov officials being corrected on trying to blame CAP as you are now.

I also work with some cross-border environmental issues that are near the border between Northern Ireland (UK) and Ireland (Republic). We have to assess planning applications for impacts to any protected sites - e.g. wetland area that has protected bird species. Typical zone of impact is 15km which means a planning app in the Republic may to be assessed for potential impacts to a protected site in Northern Ireland or vice versa. This was fine before Brexit because the EU framework (NATURA) meant comparable systems - targets and objectives for each site. So after Brexit we were concerned things would get more complicated. Well guess what, they didn't. The UK post-Brexit kept the same system of targets and objectives as they developed under the EU. It makes no sense to remove it.

Liz is probably just taking the L for the party, in exchange for a high-paying board position after politics. It’s also helpful for the Tories to sabotage the economy weirdly, provided that they’re counting on losing the next election - it’s a common thing here in Australia; LNP borrows a bunch of money, gives deals to rich friends, sells national assets for a quick buck, and then when Labour gets in, Murdoch-run media blasts Labour for having such a huge national debt and being fiscally irresponsible.

She says the organizations that offer women tough jobs believe they win either way: if the woman succeeds, the company is better off.

comment,irjuo1u,,"she had a ""fiscal event"" in which they announced a raft of radical measures to grow the economy. except its hard to find an economist who thinks it will work, and the reason it was a ""fiscal event"" rather than a budget is probably that they could avoid impact assessments done by the office for budget responsibility, which you have to have for an actual budget.     
this fiscal event announced a very large tax cut for the very wealthy, a very small tax cut for the normal workers and nothing at all for those on benefits. well, thats not quite right - they announced that those on benefits will face slightly harsher restrictions. they also promised a cancellation in the rise in corporation tax and a removal of limits on bankers bonuses.       
the immediate effect of this was the pound crashing against all currencies, with the lowest point reached against the dollar since records began. this in turn forced speculation that the bank of england would have to raise interest rates, which made mortgage lenders withdraw their offers (with some refusing to make any further offers) and will lead to hundreds of pounds a month being added to the mortgages of people who already have them, which more than wipes out any tax saving from the ""fiscal event"" for those people. all while entering the worst cost of living crisis in decades and decades.      
before that, during the leadership contest, she said the first minister of scotland should be ignored, which alienated many north of the border. since taking power, she has not spoke or written to any of the devolved administrations leaders, which has alienated many in NI and Wales too. she was also warned that the pound would crash and mortgages would increase if she went ahead with her proposals. and she said they wouldnt and everything will be fine. (spoiler alert: it was not fine)    
since the ""fiscal event"" she has done a series of interviews (after being silent for a week), each one of which she has come across as a bit of a moron with all the personality and charisma of a dead frog. she steadfastly repeated her help with energy bills policy as the answer to every question, because thats the only policy that isnt seen as a *complete* disaster. except it is, because that policy caps bills at 3x what they were a couple of years ago while maintaining exorbitant oil and gas profits at the expense of the taxpayer, to the tune of £150bn. and we should be grateful for this, apparently.",10/8/22 23:13,xyyufn

Problem is, in Britain it's fashionable to blame the country's problems on wealthy people. There is a huge chunk of people who believe our problems are caused by the wealthy, and that all solutions to any lack of resources involve the government taking even more money from people richer than me.

To be fair on them, the corporate culture in the UK is full of short term thinking and the country suffers from under investment in the private sector, resulting in low productivity. This is evidenced by the relatively high dividend yield of the FTSE 100. Investors are obsessed with getting an income rather than long term capital investment like they have in the US.

His planning reforms only led to NIMBY's blocking every development out there (including on-shore wind which would be quite useful to have right now).

He cancelled a whole load of infrastructure projects (many of which were reintroduced later at a bigger cost) though miraculously, the one money pit he could have cancelled (HS2) he continued burning money on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_and_Co-operative

> Candidates contest elections under an electoral alliance between the two parties, that was first agreed in 1927. This agreement recognises the independence of the two parties and commits them to not standing against each other in elections. **It also sets out the procedures for both parties to select joint candidates and interact at a local and national level.**

> There were **26 Labour and Co-operative Party MPs elected at the December 2019 election, making it the fourth largest political grouping in the House of Commons**, although Labour and Co-operative MPs are generally included in Labour totals.

While it would never happen because they wouldn't take the role, if the vote totals turn out as the polls say, and more than 60 Labour/Co-op MP's were elected (59 is the maximum for SNP which polls say would be the opposition), then it would mean that some MP's would jointly be part of the government (Labour) and the Opposition (Co-op)",10/9/22 15:46,xyyufn

comment,irjqwcb,,"Basic explanation:

There's a group within the Conservative party (the 1922 committee) who set the internal rules for leadership elections, VoNC, etc. 

Under current rules/conventions, the 1922 committee can issue a VoNC if a 15% of currently sitting Tory MPs write a letter to the chairman of the 1922 committee expressing their loss in confidence in the leader. If that threshold is met, all currently sitting Tory MPs vote in a VoNC. If its decided that the party has no confidence in the leader, a new leadership election is held (from which the current leader is barred). If its decided that the party *does* have confidence in the leader, they're safe from another VoNC for a year. New leaders are given the benefit of being safe from a VoNC for a year, also.

It's important to note that the 1922 committee members can meet at any time to change the rules, if they wish.

May survived a VoNC, and the 1922 committee threatened to change the rules to allow another VoNC as her approval ratings continued to plummet and her government tied itself in loops and was unable to function. She resigned so that she didn't have to face the disgrace of a second VoNC.

Johnson survived a VoNC (by a finer margin than May). About a week later he was sort of ambushed by his cabinet (many of whom had only just assumed their posts) and asked to resign or they'd find another way to oust him. There were rumours at the time that Johnson agreed to resign, so that he could engineer a come back, as a resignation wouldn't bar him from running in a leadership election.

Truss technically has a year of safety, but the Tories and the 1922 committee in particular still managed to find a way to get rid of May and Johnson under similar circumstances.",10/8/22 22:43,xyyufn
comment,irjvgzr,,"You are right to. Someone has already explained the 1922 committee so I won't repeat.

At any other point prior to Johnson, this kind of situation would see the resignation of the Prime Minister.

They set out on a path of aggressive austerity, completely destroying many of our public services and driving people into poverty. The DwP under their watch set targets for sanctioning people's benefits, leading to many sick and disabled people without any way to support themselves. Single parents denied assistance for being five minutes late to an appointment. People died because of these policies. Their solution to this was to mislead the public with realterms vs. actual spending statistics, and changing the definition of poverty, to make it look like they were hitting their poverty targets. They gutted out NHS purely for Ideological reasons, to the point where you now have to book an appointment in advance to visit A&E. 

Cameron himself arrogantly called an EU referendum (which was such a fringe issue in the UK before his leadership) purely to squash divisions within his own party, because he assumed he could half arse a campaign to remain. He said that he would uphold the results of the referendum, which was only advisory in its legal bearing, and instead fucked off so that he wouldn't be remembered for it's fallout. This led to the lunatic fringe of the Tory party coming to the fore and leading us on a path to a no deal Brexit which is currently destroying us economically and socially. 

Even if you ignore the referendum, his policies have been killing people and driving a greater wedge between the rich and the poor in this country for years.

For the longest time, I thought they were regular things like they work in the US. But then I remember Boris was able to call an election timed so that his poll numbers were good? And now this article mentions that a majority of people are calling for another snap election?

Does the opposition have the ability to call an election, or is it only the ruling party/PM/monarch (rarely)?

I feel like if the ruling party was able to choose an election whenever they wanted, then the people in power would never lose power since they could call an election whenever they were doing well in the polls.

comment,irk0s83,,"The problem is that intelligent politics are nuanced: There are many times supporting something you are nominally against is the wiser move (because of circumstance), and sometimes it's the reverse where you don't support something you normally should. After all: Politics is the art of finding a solution that nobody likes but everyone is equally unhappy.

That said, intelligent politics has three main opponents:

* The average person doesn't understand nuance (The classic line of ""Think of how stupid the average person is, 50% are stupider than that."" comes into play)

* The stupidest people are also generally the loudest.

* The average voter tends to just blindly follow whatever party/organization they are nominally aligned with.

Combining these three factors with everyone getting most of their news from social media these days, and you end up with a political situation where the discourse is lead by the loudest and stupidest. Parties have to follow public opinion or spend a ton of effort trying to direct it, meanwhile they can't do anything nuanced because the nuance will be ignored and the only thing that will be discussed is ""[INSERT POLITICIAN] is against [WHATEVER THE TOPIC WAS]"".

comment,irlbg0n,,"In my opinion, it's because of the structure of your typical right wing bloc.

Very broadly speaking, you have the Cadre and the Party (because using vaguely communist terms to describe Ring Wingers amuses me.)

The Cadre is the people in it for the money and the power. They can, in large part, trace their roots back to the Aristocracies, Gentries, Patricians and so of old. To borrow an analogy from the Haitian Revolution, the 'Big Whites'.

The Cadre is very much outnumbered by the Party. The Party, the 'Little Whites' in our Haitian terms, aren't in it for the money. In American terms, they're the Gods-Guns-Gays crowd. And, like our Haitian Little Whites, they're not in it for the money, they're in it to preserve a social hierarchy that keeps a nice comfortable cushion of people beneath them in status. They're in it for the Hierarchy.

You may notice that our two groups are in it for different reasons. Therein lies the problem.

For the longest time, the Cadre was able to keep control of the Party. They said the right things, banged the right drums, blew the right dogwhistles and threw a little red meat now and then, and the Party kept voting for them.

Then... *Something* happened. Flippantly, I'm inclined to say 'Social Media', but that doesn't really convey what I think happened.

See, how I think it used to be was that the Party *needed*, or at least *never thought to not use*, the Cadre for political organisation and direction. I mean, if you're in it for the Hierarchy, then you find someone to tell you what to do, surely. Which caused political thought and doctrine to always get... *Filtered* through the Cadre. Ideas get fed to the Cadre, and then they come back with it and go 'well, here's what that *means.*' (Hint: It means things that are beneficial for the Cadre.)

Crucial to all this is that the Cadre understands that they are *not* the Party, and that they are, to some extent, leading the Party on. The Cadre is trying to piggyback the Party into power, whilst retaining the power.

And then... Social Media. And the Party starts talking to each other politically. And they collectively come to two realisations:

1) We, the Party, do not believe in the same things as they, the Cadre. (Or at the very least, they are failing to deliver on what we were promised.)

2) *There's a lot more of us then there are of them.*

So if they all just *show up,* they win. They *are* the Party, without them, there's nothing, and without the Cadre... Well, who cares? They don't believe in what we believe.

comment,irkgs1s,,"An election has to be called with five years of the previous one. The 2010 election was set at effectively the last point it could be. When the Conservative party was the biggest party but not a majority, they did a deal with the then third biggest party, the Liberal Democrats, for a coalition. To secure this, they agreed to fixed parliamentary terms of five years but they could call one sooner if put to a vote and a set amount of MPs agreed.

This has now been overturned and has reverted to what it was like before, the PM goes to the monarch to disolve parliament and a new election is called, usually four or so weeks. The opposition can call a vote of no confidence in the governmemt as some have said.

As for parties calling elections when in power and to their adventage, yes, it's been done a lot. Sir Anthony Eden, in '55 who called an election pretty much straight away after becoming PM. He resigned because of mishandling Suez so his successor, Harold McMillan, waited for a bounce and went to an election and got a bigger majority, but this was before the five years. Labour did it in 1966, less than two years after the 1964 election to get a bigger majority and increased their seats by 47. May thought she was going to do similar in 2017 but messed up and lost seats, only two years after an election and Johnson held one in 2019 and got an 80 odd seat majority.",10/9/22 2:05,xyyufn
comment,irkjz3p,,"You are right,  and that is a risk, but usually the manifesto has a pretty clear timeline (pain at tge beginning tax cuts etc at the end) and a GE is held in relativelt orderly fashion. Unless youre Theresa May; she called an election in an effort to increase her mandate (which she calculated would give her more power in Brexit negotiations) but proceeded to lose the governmental majority and force the conservatives into an agreement with the Democratoc Unionist Party in Northern Ireland (that in itself is interesting but a totally different subject). As you can imagine, this didn't increase her ability to negotiate a deal at all leading to the Conservatives putting in their letters of no confidence. She survived the secret ballot but surviving isn't enough, you have to win convincingly and prove you can still get legislation through parliament. Even though she won, everyone knew it was over for her and a short while later she resigned, leading to a leadership contest and the Johnson circus. 

A method by which the opposition can force an election is by tabling a motion of no confidence and if the house votes in for it, the government falls, the King dissolves parliament and a general election ensues. Winning these, doesn't mean you generally stay on, the very fact one is tabled is usually enough to bring about resignation of the Prime Minister.

Indirect oligarchy as demonstrated by the last three leaders being leaders we did not select as a country under the mandate and manifesto of the leaders' direction or aims.

One led by Chamberlain was against all of this and won out, leading to only a small increase in funding for the airforce (which is why it was decent in 1939/40) and some of the lowest funding for defense ever in UK history since the Napoleonic wars (!). The reason appeasement is such an abject failure and the nadir of UK politics is because Chamberlain was one of the most important factors in requiring it - he led it and it failed and encouraged German militarism.

comment,irlkfdc,,"Depends how the people view her and lasting legacy as well as the short term loss.

Eden should be regarded by most people as the worst leader we've ever had. As stated before he caused not just a war of the Suez Crisis but conspired with Israel and France to do it. His actions ended British and French hegemony and standing in the world. He, it could be argued transformed the cold war as it placed dead centre USA and USSR as the policemen of the world. His actions affected our economy, domestic quality of life, and foreign policy. He objectively the worst by a large margin.

Chamberlain, while yes as stated before he was against going to war and tried, unsuccessfully to do so, it is important his view was not the minority but the majority at the time in the British Isles. Remember that fascism wasn't seen as this horrific monstrous ideology at the time and many leaders underestimated Adolf Hitler. The appetite for war was not there, the wounds from the first world war were still fresh and places were still recovering. On economy and domestic issues Chamberlain was significantly better. He was average pm he probably wasn't close to Eden.

Liz Truss has managed to somehow in her few weeks, crash the pound, mess with the monarchy, cause inflation to rise, narrowly miss causing a global financial crisis thanks to intervention from the bank of England adding billions to the debt, create a policy that was extremely unpopular and did not make much fiscal sense then U turn on it without tell her aides and cabinet, tell people that rationing is being planned for in the winter after telling everyone that won't be happening also on top of that the reason we are at risk of rationing is not because we can't generate enough, it's we can't store enough and the person who closed the storage facilities was Liz. She's already had more scandals in her party as well as her members are fighting over what policy direction is right publicly.  She is definitely a contender for second. 

Boris Johnson actually might be considered the second worst as well. While not as bad at pr as Liz his actions and scandals (which were numerous) have left the country in a comparable places as both Chamberlain and Eden. The botched attempt at Brexit has reopened old wounds and pushed the country into a disadvantageous trading position. He undid any benefit from Cameron and May's austerity and managed to push the debt further than any labour government without having the quality of life improvements. He had to be removed from office by literally almost half the government resigning... His moral record is another thing as well that make the man unpalpable but it's not as objective.

I agree that party politics ultimately has the benefit of continuity. I'd argue however that this continuity is only possible due to the efforts of the nominally apolitical civil service, and less to do with near annual cabinet reshuffles making their jobs harder. This was a problem under the coalition, with ministers being replaced every 5 minutes. It let ministers come in, do their dirty deed, and rejoin the hive and replaced with another. The problem perculated up ranks. Now a prime minister is a one-job hot seat anyone can take for 6 months to push something horrendous through, gut a department's budget and sell its organs, take the flak, and backbench themselves for the next one without calling an election. 

I firmly believe that the only way to stop this problem is to limit what power an incumbent prime minister can hold without an election reaffirming the party's mandate. It makes the job something you take for the duration of your term, but if needs must and you become too unpopular, you can resign and pass a limited version of your mandated power on. It is perfectly valid to want a say in who leads us, and that vote should matter. The power the prime minister has over us is practically superlative, as well the power they hold over our public sector through ministers too. To claim we only vote for a party I think betrays this. It's more that we're voting for the prime minister's underlings, not for the party.

comment,iqqregd,,"Happy to go off topic.  

Maybe my dislike is that I don't see electing a PM as working.  So you vote for your MP and another vote for PM.  What happens when changing another MP from the party or a general election or a PM of a different party?

Under the current system we vote for a MP and the party in government picks a leader.  Like Brexit, people voted for it and we are stuck with making it work - that doesn't make the system wrong even though the result sucks.  

Fundamentally the issue is many people don't take their responsibility to vote seriously, tinkering with this won't change this.  People voted for conservatives and not Boris and they got conservatives.

If we required an election when we removed a prime minister, parties would keep whoever was in charge.  Then we get the laws where PMs can't be charged or investigated whilst in office.  No way would Boris have been kicked out if it meant an election and nothing but old scandal would have been talked about, not doing their job (good or bad).

We can't really have governrment mandates binding.  If that was the case then when Covid hit, the Tories would of had to cut taxes and not provide Covid support, whilst the country was in crisis or spend months calling an election (during a pandemic where groups of people are not ideal). If you look at it Truss is probably closer than Boris was.

I think one of the failings of political systems is that there is a short term view in policies.  Oh, we're only going to be in power 5 to 10 years so this huge project can be scrapped as we won't see the benefit (HS2 scaling for example).  Elections for leaders only make this worse.

One of the things the Tories have managed to do is shift direction with each leadership, so some of their policies have been consistent but adapting to public sentiment.  Energy is a good example if I have to pick one I actually like.

If I was to limit successor PM powers on resignation, I don't think we'd need to change all that much honestly. It wouldn't require a voting reform, it would just pose the incentive for prime ministers to truly own the years they take office for the duration of their term, and should they not, the power must be reaffirmed in the party's new leader. For sure it would increase the frequency of elections during bad governments, but it's far more democratic than the current blank cheque the tories have had since 2015. 

I agree that government mandates are fluid, but I think you perceived a lot more rigidity in this than there really was. Its merely limiting successor unelected ministers' powers until a new election result. The limits would of course be subject to the current affairs of the day, but I think a heavily symbolic one would be limiting the powers the prime minister has over the crown. Anything significant, as you say, would be cleared up by the next election anyway. But such a symbol would finally put a ceiling over Downing Street, however symbolic it is.",10/2/22 16:04,xte9ca

comment,iq1xt2y,,"I'm guessing you're British and already know this, so this is mostly for other readers.

Here's my view. Truss knows the next election is unsalvageable because:

* Brexit fanaticism has killed any chance of Tories facilitating business with their largest customer, the EU.
* Her own rhetoric paralyzes her ability to cut a deal with them because she has to keep pretending Britain holds all the cards and is putting the screws on the EU who will cave any day now. Every conservative voter is demanding the Tories cut a deal with the EU for the specific regulation that affects themselves while telling the EU to fuck off on any regulation that affects literally anyone else, including other conservative voters.
* They can't plausibly blame the EU for Tory failings any more because they aren't part of the EU any more. And they can't plausibly blame Labour either because the last Labour government was over a decade ago. Not that this stops the Tories from trying to blame them anyway.
* Since the entire damn Brexit thing was to stop EU immigrants and there's a massive shortage of unskilled labor, the Tories have increased the number of immigrants from India and other Third Word countries. But Tory voters hate Indian immigrants even more than EU immigrants.
* Brexit and Tory mismanagement in general has gutted the safeguards for the common man so hard that even conservative voters can't put up with it just to spite the libs.
* There's a massive housing crisis which the Tories have shown no interest in resolving because it would hurt the pockets of their favorite donors.
* The ongoing Ukraine crisis has fucked the economy even harder so a bad situation has become close to apocalyptic.
* Boris' partying while the rest of the country was in lockdown is still fresh in people's minds. This one believe it or not is the reason the Tory voters kicked him out, *not the rest of this fuckery*.
* Labour is leading polls by 8 percentage points (40% intend to vote Labour vs 32% Tories - this means 20% more people intend to vote Labour than Tories). Even Tory die-hards are planning to sit the next election out.
* Keir Starmer is much less easy a target than Jeremy Corbyn and so far all the Murdoch efforts to rubbish his image have failed.
* Tory leadership and Murdoch are probably thinking Labour getting in for a term isn't so bad since they can blame everything on them again. Watch as suddenly all the problems with Brexit will be Labour's fault. ""Brexit would have been nothing but sunny uplands except for remoaner Labour sabotaging everything!""

Hence she is nicking every penny she can for her mates by slashing taxes and borrowing buckets of cash. This has the side effect of making things even harder for the incoming Labour government which the Tories can blame them for.",9/27/22 5:08,xoqsc8

comment,iq34pl1,,"**The Two Santa Claus Theory**

The Two Santa Claus Theory is a political theory and strategy published by Wanniski in 1976, which he promoted within the United States Republican Party.[15][16] The theory states that in democratic elections, if members of the rival Democratic Party appeal to voters by proposing programs to help people, then the Republicans cannot gain broader appeal by proposing less spending. The first ""Santa Claus"" of the theory title refers to the Democrats who promise programs to help the disadvantaged. The ""Two Santa Claus Theory"" recommends that the Republicans must assume the role of a second Santa Claus by not arguing to cut spending but offering the option of cutting taxes.

According to Wanniski, the theory is simple. In 1976, he wrote that the Two-Santa Claus Theory suggests that ""the Republicans should concentrate on tax-rate reduction. As they succeed in expanding incentives to produce, they will move the economy back to full employment and thereby reduce social pressures for public spending. Just as an increase in Government spending inevitably means taxes must be raised, a cut in tax rates—by expanding the private sector—will diminish the relative size of the public sector.""[16] Wanniski suggested this position, as left-liberal observer Thom Hartmann has clarified, **so that the Democrats would ""have to be anti-Santas by raising taxes, or anti-Santas by cutting spending. Either one would lose them elections.""**",9/27/22 13:19,xoqsc8
comment,iq19eqy,,"It makes a lot less sense in a British context though - the reason the Republicans can do it is because they are usually able to win control of at least one house of Congress and essentially freeze things in place.

The British system doesn't really have any equivalent - unless they happen to be in a coalition government (which would require Truss to deny Labour a majority) the PM is only checked by their own party and has extremely broad powers as a result. There is no equivalent of Mitch McConnel, and a sufficiently aggressive PM could abolish the Supreme Court if it pissed them off.",9/27/22 2:05,xoqsc8

> The British government has been accused of abandoning people in the global south after it failed to commit to boosting its spending on a fund established to fight three of the world&#039;s deadliest diseases: malaria, tuberculosis and Aids.Liz Truss&#039;s new administration became the only major world power not to raise its spending at a UN pledging event for the Global Fund, a highly successful 20-year-old initiative, shocking global health campaigners.

> The UK said it would make a pledge later, but aid agencies pointed out that Truss had found time to lift the cap on bankers&#039; bonuses and to commit at least &pound;2.3bn in military aid to Ukraine in 2023.David Lammy, the UK&#039;s shadow foreign secretary, said cynicism was creeping into some African leaders&#039; views of the UK approach to aid.

> The US has already committed to contributing $6bn to the Global Fund over the next three years, a 30% increase on its last replenishment.

Not fully true. You can have minority parties form a coalition if that coalition ends up with more seats than any other party or coalition. Coalition governments are not common in the UK (last one was Conservatives and Liberal Democrats from 2010 to 2015, but that was the first one since WW2), but they do happen.

edit: I am not sure if the UK ever had a situation where the party, without the most seats, formed a coalition and held the premiership.

A general election is held when parliament is dissolved, the Queen has the power to dissolve Parliament. She uses this power in one of 3 scenarios:
1.	The Prime Minister requests an election can be refused but very unlikely.
2.	It’s overdue.
3.	Parliament doesn’t support the government, this is seen if a vote of no confidence in the government passes, they can’t pass a Queen’s speech or budget. Although if the Queen believes a different PM could lead a government with the support of parliament a general election isn’t required.

It does have some benefits & disadvantages such as we’d get an election instead of the government shutdown if they can’t pass a budget although we don’t have a debt limit so in practice government would just carry on with the current budget until there’s a new government.

It does give the PM an electoral advantage as they can choose when to hold an election during the coalition (2010-2015) this was countered by removing the power from the PM requiring 66% of parliament to vote for an election however this was flawed because it could be ignored with a 50% vote of parliament & it turns out opposition parties usually want an election.

The Highland Council, iirc, is still run by a coalition of independent candidates after the major parties coalition fell, and I'd be surprised if a few others didn't have a minority coalition use dysfunction between the major parties to form a government.

There is a convention that they won’t flat out reject any policy that is in a government’s manifesto.

Them doing ok at their job is a obstacle in reforming the House of Lords as the consensus is it needs reform but people don’t want it to be less capable. There are several possible reforms: 
1.	Remove the hereditary Lords, not really controversial. 
2.	Remove the spiritual Lords, personally I’d expand this so other bodies such as the Royal Society, etc. so we get actual experts in various fields. 
3.	Reduce the number of Lords it’s currently the second biggest political chamber in the world after the Chinese NPC. 
4.	To be made an elected house, there are two potential issues with this, would it slow down or lead to deadlock if they have a democratic mandate also it would probably require PR which would spur reform for the House of Commons so will forever be kicked down the road.
